            El rap√Ædo is a question game between two players. Each player
              must take turns answering the questions asked before the end of their timer
              (60 seconds). If the timer of one of the players reaches zero, the game ends
              and his opponent wins the game.

            Before starting, the player who joins the game must refresh the page once. Then,
            each player must click once on "ready" to start the game.
            <br /> <br />
            The player who created the game always starts first. At the beginning of each turn, the
            player must click on "ready" to be able to answer the question.
            <br /> <br />
            As long as the first player has not found the correct answer to a question, another is
            asked and so on until he finds the correct answer.
            <br /> <br />
            When a player has found the correct answer to a question, it is the turn of the other
            player to click on "ready" and answer his question.
            <br /> <br />
            When a player's timer reaches 0, a window is displayed to know the winner and the 
            loser. You will automatically be redirected to the home page with your points update.
