Is a project for my school. In fact, i had to create a mini game of questions.

2 player play in the same party and they have a chrono of 60 sec each other. the fisrt at 0 sec lose and the game is finish.

I use javascript with AJAX for the game engine and PHP for the backend.

We weren't allow to use boostrap or library that we had not seen during classes so all is from Scratch.
